# In this code, two functions are defined. The first function called searchWord is the same function that was explained in the previous answers. The second function called checkWord is also an example of using the searchWord function. In this function, first a string named str and a word named word are defined, and then using the searchWord function and sending the string and word as input, it is checked whether the word exists in the string or not. If the word exists, the message "word found." It is displayed in the browser console. Otherwise, the error message "Word not found." It is displayed in the browser console. Finally, the checkWord function is called to execute the example using the searchWord function.
