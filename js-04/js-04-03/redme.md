# In this code, a new class called Product is defined, which includes the attributes name (product name), price (product price) and material (product number). Also, two methods named addToCart and removeFromCart are defined to add the product to the cart and remove it from the cart, respectively.

# After the class is defined, an object is created from it using the new keyword. Then by calling the addToCart and removeFromCart methods on this object, the product is added to the cart and then removed from the cart. In this example, the code, the action of adding to the shopping cart and removing from the shopping cart are displayed as messages in the console. In fact, the codes related to add to cart and remove from cart operations are not fully implemented and should be completed by you as appropriate.
