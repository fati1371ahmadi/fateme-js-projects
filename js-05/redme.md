# In general, the fillArrayWithRandomObjects function creates an array of random objects by adding objects to it as many times as the count provided as input. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

# const array = [];: Initially, an empty array named array is created to hold the random objects.

# for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {: A for loop is created that repeats for the specified count times.}

# array.push({ ... });: In each loop iteration, a random object is added to the array. The object has three properties:

# number: A random number between 1 and 100.
# date: A random date between the year 2000 and the current date.
# word: A random 5-character word generated using the Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 7) function.
# return array;: After completing the loop, the array containing the random objects is returned as the function's output.

# In the main part of the code, an array named myArray is created by calling the fillArrayWithRandomObjects function with the desired number of objects. Finally, using console.log, the contents of the array are displayed.
